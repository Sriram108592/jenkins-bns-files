Yes, you can generate and send an email from a Python script running inside a Docker container. Here is a basic example of how you can achieve this:

1. **Set Up Dockerfile**:
   - Create a Dockerfile to define the environment.
   - Install necessary dependencies (e.g., `smtplib` for sending emails).

2. **Write Python Script**:
   - Create a Python script to generate the output and send it via email.

3. **Build and Run Docker Container**:
   - Build the Docker image and run the container.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Dockerfile

Create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Step 2: requirements.txt

Create a `requirements.txt` file to list any Python packages your script needs. For sending emails, you typically don't need any external libraries, as `smtplib` is part of the Python standard library. However, if you need to parse HTML or create attachments, you might need additional packages like `email` or `MIMEText`:

```
email
```

### Step 3: Python Script

Create a file named `app.py` with the following content:

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart

# Email details
sender_email = "your_email@example.com"
receiver_email = "receiver_email@example.com"
password = "your_password"

# Create the email content
subject = "Test Email from Docker"
body = "This is a test email sent from a Docker container!"

# Create a multipart message and set headers
message = MIMEMultipart()
message["From"] = sender_email
message["To"] = receiver_email
message["Subject"] = subject

# Add body to email
message.attach(MIMEText(body, "plain"))

# Connect to the server and send the email
try:
    server = smtplib.SMTP("smtp.example.com", 587)  # Replace with your SMTP server
    server.starttls()  # Secure the connection
    server.login(sender_email, password)
    server.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, message.as_string())
    server.quit()
    print("Email sent successfully!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

### Step 4: Build and Run the Docker Container

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, and `app.py`.

2. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t email-sender .
   ```

3. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run email-sender
   ```

Make sure to replace `smtp.example.com`, `your_email@example.com`, and `your_password` with your actual SMTP server details and email credentials. For security reasons, consider using environment variables or Docker secrets to handle sensitive information like passwords.

This setup will allow you to generate and send an email from a Python script running inside a Docker container.


fffffffffgggggggfff
If you need to send emails from a custom mailbox using a Python script running in a Docker container, you will likely need to configure your SMTP server and credentials accordingly. Here is a detailed guide:

### Step 1: Dockerfile

Create a Dockerfile to define your Docker environment:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Step 2: requirements.txt

Create a `requirements.txt` file. If you're only sending basic emails, you don't need any additional libraries since `smtplib` is included with Python. However, if you plan to use more advanced features, you might need additional libraries:

```
email
```

### Step 3: Python Script

Create a Python script `app.py` that will handle email generation and sending:

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
import os

# Load environment variables for email credentials
sender_email = os.getenv("SENDER_EMAIL")
receiver_email = os.getenv("RECEIVER_EMAIL")
password = os.getenv("EMAIL_PASSWORD")
smtp_server = os.getenv("SMTP_SERVER")
smtp_port = os.getenv("SMTP_PORT", 587)

# Create the email content
subject = "Test Email from Custom Mailbox in Docker"
body = "This is a test email sent from a Docker container using a custom mailbox!"

# Create a multipart message and set headers
message = MIMEMultipart()
message["From"] = sender_email
message["To"] = receiver_email
message["Subject"] = subject

# Add body to email
message.attach(MIMEText(body, "plain"))

# Connect to the server and send the email
try:
    server = smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port)
    server.starttls()  # Secure the connection
    server.login(sender_email, password)
    server.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, message.as_string())
    server.quit()
    print("Email sent successfully!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

### Step 4: Environment Variables

Instead of hardcoding sensitive information like email credentials and SMTP server details in your script, use environment variables. Create a `.env` file to store these variables:

```
SENDER_EMAIL=your_custom_email@example.com
RECEIVER_EMAIL=receiver_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.custommailbox.com
SMTP_PORT=587
```

### Step 5: Docker Compose

To manage environment variables and Docker container settings, you can use Docker Compose. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  email-sender:
    build: .
    environment:
      - SENDER_EMAIL=${SENDER_EMAIL}
      - RECEIVER_EMAIL=${RECEIVER_EMAIL}
      - EMAIL_PASSWORD=${EMAIL_PASSWORD}
      - SMTP_SERVER=${SMTP_SERVER}
      - SMTP_PORT=${SMTP_PORT}
```

### Step 6: Build and Run the Docker Container

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, `app.py`, `.env`, and `docker-compose.yml`.

2. Build and run the Docker container with Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

This setup uses Docker Compose to manage environment variables securely and ensures that your Python script inside the Docker container can send emails from a custom mailbox. Make sure to replace placeholder values in the `.env` file with your actual email credentials and SMTP server details.
----------------------
To send emails with specific documents attached using the Outlook API from a Python script running in a Docker container, you need to:

1. Set up Azure AD and register an application to get client credentials.
2. Use the Microsoft Graph API to send emails.

Here is a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Register Application in Azure AD

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to "Azure Active Directory" -> "App registrations" -> "New registration".
3. Register a new application and take note of the `Client ID` and `Tenant ID`.
4. Under "Certificates & secrets", create a new client secret and save it securely.
5. Under "API permissions", add `Mail.Send` permission for Microsoft Graph API and grant admin consent.

### Step 2: Dockerfile

Create a Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install necessary packages
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Step 3: requirements.txt

List the required packages:

```
msal
requests
```

### Step 4: Python Script

Create `app.py` to handle authentication and email sending:

```python
import os
import requests
from msal import ConfidentialClientApplication

# Load environment variables
tenant_id = os.getenv("TENANT_ID")
client_id = os.getenv("CLIENT_ID")
client_secret = os.getenv("CLIENT_SECRET")
sender_email = os.getenv("SENDER_EMAIL")
receiver_email = os.getenv("RECEIVER_EMAIL")

# MSAL authentication
authority = f"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant_id}"
app = ConfidentialClientApplication(
    client_id,
    authority=authority,
    client_credential=client_secret,
)

# Acquire token
token_response = app.acquire_token_for_client(scopes=["https://graph.microsoft.com/.default"])
access_token = token_response.get("access_token")

# Email details
subject = "Test Email with Attachment"
body = "This is a test email sent from a Docker container with an attachment."
file_path = "/app/document.pdf"  # Replace with the actual path to your document
file_name = "document.pdf"       # Replace with the actual filename

# Read the file to attach
with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
    file_content = f.read()

# Create the email message
email_message = {
    "message": {
        "subject": subject,
        "body": {
            "contentType": "Text",
            "content": body
        },
        "toRecipients": [
            {
                "emailAddress": {
                    "address": receiver_email
                }
            }
        ],
        "attachments": [
            {
                "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.fileAttachment",
                "name": file_name,
                "contentBytes": file_content.decode("latin1")  # decode bytes for JSON compatibility
            }
        ]
    }
}

# Send the email
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
response = requests.post(
    "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{sender_email}/sendMail",
    headers=headers,
    json=email_message
)

if response.status_code == 202:
    print("Email sent successfully!")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
    print(response.json())
```

### Step 5: Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file to store sensitive information:

```
TENANT_ID=your_tenant_id
CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
SENDER_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
RECEIVER_EMAIL=receiver_email@example.com
```

### Step 6: Docker Compose

Create `docker-compose.yml` for managing environment variables and settings:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  email-sender:
    build: .
    environment:
      - TENANT_ID=${TENANT_ID}
      - CLIENT_ID=${CLIENT_ID}
      - CLIENT_SECRET=${CLIENT_SECRET}
      - SENDER_EMAIL=${SENDER_EMAIL}
      - RECEIVER_EMAIL=${RECEIVER_EMAIL}
    volumes:
      - ./document.pdf:/app/document.pdf  # Mount the document to be attached
```

### Step 7: Build and Run the Docker Container

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, `app.py`, `.env`, and `docker-compose.yml`.

2. Build and run the Docker container with Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

Make sure to replace placeholder values with actual values from your Azure AD registration and email details. This setup allows you to send emails with attachments from a custom mailbox using the Microsoft Graph API, all managed within a Docker container.
