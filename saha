[13/06, 17:41] Yogesh@AMAT: Here's an outline for documenting automation for Jira Xray integration to create Jira issues for discovered CVEs using integration profiles, policies, and watches:
Scenario: Automatically create Jira issues for newly discovered CVEs after an Xray scan.
Tools:
 * Jira
 * Xray
 * JFrog Xray (Xray server product)
Steps:
 * Configure Xray Integration Profile:
   * Create a new Xray integration profile that defines the Jira project and issue type for created vulnerabilities.
 * Establish Xray Policy:
   * Design an Xray policy to identify vulnerabilities based on severity, CVE ID patterns, or custom criteria.
 * Set Up Xray Watch:
   * Create a watch in Xray that triggers on newly discovered vulnerabilities matching the established policy.
   * Configure the watch to leverage the previously defined integration profile to automatically generate Jira issues for identified CVEs.
Documentation:
 * Clearly describe the scenario and tools involved.
 * Provide step-by-step instructions for creating the Xray integration profile, policy, and watch.
 * Include details on configuring the policy criteria for selecting relevant CVEs and the mapping of Xray vulnerability data to Jira issue fields.
Benefits:
 * Leverage Xray's built-in features for streamlined automation.
 * Define granular control over which CVEs trigger Jira issue creation through policies.
 * Simplify maintenance with a centralized approach in Xray.
Remember to consult JFrog Xray documentation for specific configuration steps and best practices.
[14/06, 11:12] Yogesh@AMAT: Requirements Document: Jira Xray Integration for CVE Automation
1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for automating the creation of Jira issues for newly discovered CVEs identified during Xray scans. The automation will leverage Xray integration profiles, policies, and watches to streamline the process.
2. Tools and Resources
 * Jira project
 * JFrog Xray (server product)
 * Users with permissions to configure Xray and Jira
3. Functional Requirements
 * Xray Integration Profile:
   * A new Xray integration profile needs to be created to specify the target Jira project and the issue type to be used for newly discovered vulnerabilities (CVEs).
 * Xray Policy:
   * An Xray policy needs to be established to identify relevant CVEs based on user-defined criteria. This could include:
     * CVE severity level (e.g., critical, high, medium)
     * Specific CVE ID patterns
     * Custom vulnerability attributes defined in Xray
 * Xray Watch:
   * A watch must be created in Xray to trigger automated actions upon discovery of new vulnerabilities matching the established policy.
   * The watch needs to be configured to leverage the previously defined integration profile. Upon identifying a matching CVE, the watch should automatically generate a new Jira issue.
4. Non-Functional Requirements
 * Security:
   * Users creating the automation must have the necessary permissions within Xray and Jira.
   * Proper authentication protocols should be followed for secure integration between Xray and Jira.
 * Performance:
   * The automation should function efficiently without significantly impacting Xray scan execution times.
 * Auditability:
   * A clear audit log should be maintained within Xray to track identified CVEs, triggered watches, and corresponding Jira issues created.
5. Success Criteria
 * The automation successfully creates Jira issues for newly discovered CVEs that meet the established Xray policy criteria.
 * The Jira issues are populated with relevant CVE details from Xray, such as CVE ID, severity, and affected components.
 * The automation process is documented for future reference and maintenance.
6. Open Issues
 * Specific details regarding CVE designation practices within your organization need to be determined to define the Xray policy criteria effectively.
 * Any custom fields used within Jira to store CVE data should be identified for proper mapping during issue creation.
7. References
 * JFrog Xray Documentation (link specific to Xray integration profiles, policies, and watches)
This requirements document provides a foundation for automating the creation of Jira issues for discovered CVEs using JFrog Xray's integration features. Remember to tailor these requirements to your specific Jira project configuration, Xray settings, and CVE designation practices.
